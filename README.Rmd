# Package **metaviz**
A compilation of functions to plot meta-analytic data using 'ggplot2'. Currently allows to 
create forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their variants, such as rainforest plots, thick forest plots, additional evidence contour enhanced funnel plots, and sunset funnel plots. In addition, functionalities for visual inference with the funnel plot are provided.
