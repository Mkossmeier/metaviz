# Package **metaviz**
Creates rainforest plots (proposed by Schild & Voracek, 2015), a variant and 
enhancement of the classic forest plot for meta-analysis. In the near future, the metaviz 
package will be extended by further, established as well as novel, plotting options for 
visualizing meta-analytic data.
