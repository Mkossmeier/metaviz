# Package **metaviz**
A compilation of functions to plot meta-analytic data using 'ggplot2'. Currently allows to 
create forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their variants, such as rainforest plots, thick forest plots, additional evidence contour funnel plots, and sunset funnel plots. In addition, functionalities for visual inference with the funnel plot are provided.

## History
### Package **metaviz** version 0.1.0

- February 6, 2017 first release on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metaviz

### Package **metaviz** version 0.1.1 (not yet on CRAN)

- March 14, 2017: Added a new function for visual inference with funnel plots: `funnelinf`. Also available as shiny app: https://metaviz.shinyapps.io/funnelinf_app/

### Package **metaviz** version 0.1.1

- June 29, 2017: Version 0.1.1 submitted to CRAN

### Package **metaviz** version 0.2

- March 16, 2018: Version 0.2 submitted to CRAN
- Greatly extended functionalities to create different types of forest plots and to align tables with study-level or summary-level information (`viz_forest`)
- Added numerous funnel plot variants including additional evidence contour funnel plots with the function `viz_funnel`.

### Package **metaviz** version 0.3

- January 14, 2019: Version 0.3 submitted to CRAN
- Added a dedicated function for sunset (power-enhanced) funnel plots (`viz_sunset`). Also available as shiny app: https://metaviz.shinyapps.io/sunset/


### Package **metaviz** version 0.3.1
- April 7th, 2020: Version 0.3.1 submitted to CRAN
- Fixed problem of up-side-down funnel plots (`viz_funnel`, `viz_sunset`, `funnelinf`) with y_axis = "se", which seemed to occur with newer versions of **ggplot2** installed.
- Function `viz_funnel` now allows to customize funnel plot contours for random effects models via the `contours_type` argument.
- Changed behavior of `viz_forest`, `viz_funnel` and `viz_sunset`, such that when output of function `rma.uni` from package **metafor** is used as input, then the `method` argument is now extracted from the `rma.uni` object.
