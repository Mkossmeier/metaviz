Description: A compilation of functions to plot meta-analytic data using ggplot2. Currently allows to 
    create forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their variants, such as rainforest plots and 
    additional evidence contour enhanced funnel plots. In addition, functionalities for visual funnel 
    plot inference are provided. In the near future, the metaviz package will be extended by further, 
    established as well as novel, plotting options for visualizing meta-analytic data.
