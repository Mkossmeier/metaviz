\title{metaviz: Forest Plots, Funnel Plots, and Visual Funnel Plot Inference for Meta-Analysis}
\description{
The package metaviz is a collection of functions to create visually
appealing and information-rich plots of meta-analytic data using ggplot2.
Functions to create several variants of forest plots (\code{viz_forest}),
funnel plots (\code{viz_funnel}, \code{viz_sunset}), and to conduct visual
inference with funnel plots (\code{funnelinf}) are provided.
}
\section{Forest plots (\code{viz_forest})}{

Several different types and variants of forest plots can be created. This includes
classic forest plots, subgroup forest plots, cumulative summary forest plots, and leave-one-out sensitivity
forest plots. In addition, the function allows to individually label and color studies and to
align tables with furhter study-level and summary-level information.

In addition to traditional forest plots, rainforest plots as well as thick forest plots can be used.
Rainforest and thick forest plots are two recently proposed variants and enhancements of
the classic forest plot. Both variants visually emphasize large studies
(with short confidence intervals and more weight in the meta-analysis), while small studies
(with wide confidence intervals and less weight in the meta-analysis) are visually less dominant.
For further details see \code{help(viz_forest)}, \code{help(viz_rainforest)}, and \code{help(viz_thickforest)}.
}

\section{Funnel plots (\code{viz_funnel}, \code{viz_sunset})}{

Numerous different funnel plot variants can be created. Options for several graphical augmentations
(e.g., confidence, significance, and additional evidence contours; choice of the ordinate; showing
study subgroups), and different statistical information displayed are provided (Egger's regression line,
and imputed studies by, as well as the adjusted summary effect from, the trim-and-fill method).
Further details and references can be found in the corresponding help file (\code{help(viz_funnel)}).

Moreover, a novel variant of the funnel plot is introduced which displays the power of studies to detect an effect
of interest (e.g., the meta-analytic summary estimate) using a two-sided Wald test. This sunset (power-enhanced)
funnel plot uses color-coded regions and a second y axis to visualize study-level power and can help to
critically examine the evidentiality and credibility of a set of studies. For further details see \code{help(viz_sunset)}.

\section{Visual inference with funnel plots (funnelinf)}{

Funnel plots are widely used in meta-analysis to assess small study effects and in particular publication bias.
However, visually examining funnel plots often leads to false conclusions. Visual inference
can help to improve the objectivity and validity of funnel plot based conclusions by guarding from
interpreting patterns in the funnel plot that are perfectly plausible by chance.
Only if the funnel plot showing the real data is identifiable out of simultaneously presented
funnel plots showing simulated data under the null hypothesis, conclusion based on visually inspecting
the real-data funnel plot might be warranted. The function \code{funnelinf} provides numerous tailored
options to conduct visual inference with the funnel plot graph (see \code{help(funnelinf)} for further details and relevant references).

\section{Meta-analytic example datasets}{

Four different example datasets from published meta-analyses are distributed
with the package: \itemize{
\item Two datasets for meta-analysis with standardized mean differences (mozart, homeopath)
\item One dataset for meta-analysis with correlation coefficients (brainvol)
\item One dataset for meta-analysis with dichotomous outcome data (exrehab).
}
More details and corresponding references can be found in the respective help files
(\code{help(mozart)}, \code{help(homeopath)}, \code{help(brainvol)}, \code{help(exrehab)}).
