Package **metaviz**
===================

Creates rainforest plots (proposed by Schild & Voracek, 2015), a variant and enhancement of the classic forest plot for meta-analysis. In addition, functionalities for visual funnel plot inference are provided. In the near future, the metaviz package will be extended by further, established as well as novel, plotting options for visualizing meta-analytic data.
