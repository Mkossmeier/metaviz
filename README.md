# Package **metaviz**

A compilation of functions to plot meta-analytic data using ‘ggplot2’.
Currently allows to create forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their
variants, such as rainforest plots, thick forest plots, additional
evidence contour funnel plots, and sunset funnel plots. In addition,
functionalities for visual inference with the funnel plot are provided.
