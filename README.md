Package **metaviz**
===================

A compilation of functions to plot meta-analytic data using ggplot2. Currently allows to create forest plots, funnel plots, and many of their variants (e.g., rainforest plots; addtional evidence contour enhanced funnel plots). In addition, functionalities for visual funnel plot inference are provided. In the near future, the metaviz package will be extended by further, established as well as novel, plotting options for visualizing meta-analytic data.
